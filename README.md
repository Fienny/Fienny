# Hi there, I'm Azizbek — Data Analyst 👋

🎓 I recently finished university and am actively building a portfolio to start working in the data field.

💻 Tech skills:
- Python (ETL, APIs, pandas, automation)
- SQL (PostgreSQL, SQLite — advanced queries & DB design)
- Power BI (self-taught, in progress)
- Experience with Docker, Flask, ESP32, MQTT (from internship)
- English: IELTS 7.5

🛠 I focus on building **real-world, useful projects**, not toy apps.  
My goal is to create tools that people can actually use.

📊 Portfolio Highlight:
- [Weather ETL Pipeline](https://github.com/Fienny/weather-etl-pipeline) — pulls live weather data via API, stores it in SQLite, and visualizes the temperature data in animated charts.
- [ETL + Dashboard Project](https://github.com/Fienny/-ETL-Dashboard-project) - CSV -> SQlite -> Dashboard (by streamlit)
- [Retail Sales Analysis & Forecast Dashboard](https://github.com/Fienny/retail_forecast_etl) - This project simulates a retail store sales analysis pipeline — from raw data to insights: ETL (Python + SQLite) and data visualization (Power BI)
